# Student-API-Companion-Repo

# Description
As a companion repo to the Lets-Make-Some-New-Students repo, this repository will offer the connectivity needed to store your student data via a REST API created using ASP .NET Core.  It uses automapper to map infomration coming from the front end securely to a SQL database for secure storage and retrival in the frontend for edits, etc. 

# Getting Started
To Get started:
1. Download the repo
2. Open Using Visual Studio and navigate into the API
3. You will need to connect your API to a database for persistent storage.  The connections exist for SQL (I suggest downloading SQL and SQL Server Management Studio), though you will need to adjust the connection strings to match your local database.
4. Run the API (with your server up and running) and use swagger to check the database connection
5. You will also need to connect your frontend properly to the API via adjusting http calls.

I hope you enjoy making this your own as, with all starter projects, that is the goal!
Happy coding :)
